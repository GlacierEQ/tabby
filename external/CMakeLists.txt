# CMake configuration for external dependencies

# This is a placeholder for external C/C++ dependencies that might be needed
# for the CMake build. Most dependencies in Tabby are managed through Cargo.

# Example of how to add a dependency:
# include(FetchContent)
# FetchContent_Declare(
#   some_lib
#   GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/example/some_lib.git
#   GIT_TAG v1.0.0
# )
# FetchContent_MakeAvailable(some_lib)
